Although I was not able to get the correct outptu, i did learn a lot during this challenge and i would like to document that here. I have attached the screenshots and the file links that i managed to make here as well.
what was observed was that during the sun cycle, the solar source provides power to all the loads and it charges the battery as well, when the satellite enters the eclipse then there is no power from the solar source and the battery powers all the loads.
during the sun cycle there is a negative high voltage and negative high current through the battery as the solar source is charging it, and during eclipse there is a low positive voltage and current, and the loads opening and closing cause drops in the voltage and current.
the current source is the mppt and the panels.
the battery is the battery of the satellite
the resistor in series with the source is are eps losses that happen due to wiring and converter.
the 4 resistors represent the 4 loads that are OBC/housekeeping,adcs,tt&c and payload.
