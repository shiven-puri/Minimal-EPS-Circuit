I used perplexity pro and chat gpt for this challenge here are the links
perplexity:https://www.perplexity.ai/search/explain-this-pdf-in-more-simpl-EVYkI4UpSBOIVYvkmclZlA

the AIs were very useful and helpful but also difficult to work with, they weren't always providing the right output, or the right answers and i had to verify all the answers myself as well.
all the other sources i used also i have mentioned in the readme.
